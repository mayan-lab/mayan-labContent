### Sentences

Volatile elements play a critical role in the evolution of Earth.Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) by which Earth acquired, andwas able to preserve its volatile budget throughout its violent accretionary history, remains uncertain. In this study, we analyzed noble gas isotopes in volcanic gases from the Yellowstone mantle plume, thought to sample the deep primordial mantle, to determine the origin of volatiles on Earth. We find that Kr and Xe isotopes within the deep mantle have a similar chondritic origin to those found previously in the upper mantle. This suggests that the Earth has retained chondritic volatiles throughout the accretion and, therefore, terrestrial volatiles cannot not solely be the result of late additions following the Moon-forming impact.
